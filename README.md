# Five-Stage-Pipeline
Five Stage Pipeline project built from scratch in quartus using verilog.  This project functions as an assembler for MIPS assembly code.

This project was done within ECE 473.  The project consisted of 4 milestones to complete, each adding additional assembly codes that needed to be functional within the assembler.

The objects of this project included:
  1. Implements the pipelined MIPS RISC processor core. The following figure is one
  example implementation.
  2. Learn to work as a team to carry out a complex design task requiring task partitioning,
  effective communication, and cooperation.
  3. Design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret experimental data.
  
The instructions required for each milestone can be seen below.
  
 Milestone 1: add, addu, sub, subu, and, or, nor, slt, sll, srl, sra, jr, nop
 
 Milestone 2: andi, ori, slti, addi, addiu, beq, bne, bgtz, bgez, lw, sw, lui
 
 Milestone 3: j, jal
 
 Milestone 4: Testing of nine programs which can be found within the project file.
 
 The following project functioned with all milestone and all test programs and took about 120 hours to complete.
